   abstract = {SU2-NEMO, a recent extension of the open-source SU2 multiphysics suite’s set of physical models and code architecture, is presented with the aim of introducing its enhanced capabilities in addressing high-enthalpy and high-Mach number flows. This paper discusses the thermal nonequilibrium and finite-rate chemistry models adopted, including a link to the Mutation++ physio-chemical library. Further, the paper discusses how the software architecture has been designed to ensure modularity, incorporating the ability to introduce additional models in an efficient manner. A review of the numerical formulation and the discretization schemes utilized for the convective fluxes is also presented. Several test cases in two- and three-dimensions are examined for validation purposes and to illustrate the performance of the solver in addressing complex nonequilibrium flows.},
