# Summary

Hypersonic flows present a unique challenges due to the complex interplay of
fluid dynamics, chemical reactions, and optical phenomena. As a signal from a
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) travels through a hypersonic flow field,
the beam would be affected by the flow. 

``HAOT`` is a Hypersonic Aerodynamics Optics Tools Python package developed to
calculate the index of refraction of a hypersonic medium.
